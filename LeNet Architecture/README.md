# LeNet

The LeNet architecture is one of the first and the most widely known CNN architectures. Proposed by Yann LeCun and others in 1998, the network contains 3 convolutional layers (with average pooling), 2 fully connected layers, and a softmax unit responsible for classifying images into their respective classes. The authors of the original paper used this architecture for recognizing handwritten digits.
